Title:  Test files for CD-TEXT parsers

The CD-TEXT test set nightcats_ii consists of two original input files

  nightcats_ii.v07t ..... Human readable definition for 3 tracks in english.
                          Sony Text File Format Version 0.7T
  katzenmusik_ii.v07t ... Human readable definition for 3 tracks in german.

From these files were derived via libburnia and cd-info

  cdtext-libburnia.cdt .. CD-TEXT packs file suitable for e.g. cdrecord
                          option textfile=nightcats_ii_en_de.cdt

  cdtext-libburnia.right  expected output of cd-info

It demonstrates:
- Multiple language blocks
- Short track names
- Abbreviated repetition of texts by single TAB

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The .cdt file was created by writing the .v07t files to a CD-RW with
3 arbitrary tracks

  cdrskin dev=/dev/sr0 -v blank=as_needed -eject \
          input_sheet_v07t=nightcats_ii.v07t \
          input_sheet_v07t=katzenmusik_ii.v07t \
          -sao -audio -swab track1 track2 track3

and by then reading its text packs and truncating the header

  cdrskin dev=/dev/sr0 -v cdtext_to_textfile=nightcats_ii_en_de.cdt
  dd skip=4 ibs=1 if=nightcats_ii_en_de.cdt of=cdtext-libburnia.cdt

Although the CD-RW written by the first cdrskin run already may serve for
generating the file nightcats_ii.right, the CD-RW was overwritten by

  cdrskin dev=/dev/sr0 -v blank=as_needed -eject \
          textfile=nightcats_ii_en_de.cdt \
          -sao -audio -swab track1 track2 track3

and then read by and truncating the header

  cd-info --no-header /dev/sr0 | tail -n+15 > cdtext-libburnia.right

The resulting file nightcats_ii.right was then checkread to verify that
it matches the original .v07t input.
The only detected deviation was that cd-info does not represent these
information fields from .v07t:
