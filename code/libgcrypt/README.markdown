## ShiftMediaProject

Shift Media Project aims to provide native Windows development libraries for libgcrypt and associated dependencies to support simpler creation and debugging of rich media content directly within Visual Studio. [https://shiftmediaproject.github.io/](https://shiftmediaproject.github.io/)

## libgcrypt

libgcrypt is a general purpose cryptographic library based on the code from GnuPG. [https://www.gnu.org/software/libgcrypt/](https://www.gnu.org/software/libgcrypt/)

Each download contains both static and dynamic libraries to choose from in both 32bit and 64bit versions.
