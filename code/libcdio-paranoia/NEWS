- Add --force-overread
  Force overreading into the lead-out portion of the disc. This option
  is only applicable when using the "-O" option with a positive sample
  offset value. Many drives are not capable of reading into this
  portion of the disc and attempting to do so on those drives will
  produce read errors and possibly hard lockups

with cdparanoia-III-10.2's license. And also, libcdio is just too large.
